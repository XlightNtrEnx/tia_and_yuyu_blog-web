        I love you, and I still do. I'm still regretting my decision to leave
        you. I'm sorry for causing hurt to you. I still cannot get back to you,
        but I hope you can forgive me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never really loved you from the start. I was at the lowest point in my
        life. I lost all my friends because I was too emotional. I saw you as
        someone I could have fun a lot with. Over time, I begin developing
        feelings for you, but it was not yet love. I was still too broken over
        what had happened. But, I saw you as a close friend and nothing more
        than that before you confessed to me. I was too scared to lose you just
        like I did with my friends so I had to take a day to collect myself.
        Eventually I decided I really did not want to lose you even if I did not
        love you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time as we interacted, I became more and more attached to you. My
        scars were healing from my drama I had. I was beginning to love you, and
        eventually I did. It drove me to creating this website for you. Showing
        my appreciation not with my money but my efforts. I was really
        heartbroken when you did not give me anything back in return for my
        efforts, even as I kept waiting and waiting. I questioned your love for
        me and that was our first fight we had.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was really hurt by that. Since then, I had stopped loving you. More
        precisely, I was too scared to love you. I did not want to get hurt
        again. But you showed me that you really did love me. I was really happy
        that you did. I was really happy with your gifts. At the same time I was
        worried about you. You had spent so much for me and yet you were not
        doing very well. You didn't have money. You had nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        You had nothing to your name. You had no sense of responsibility. You
        had no hobbies. You had no job. If I don't address them now, they will
        not magically disappear after marriage. I needed to change you, at the
        same time, love to me was not changing someone, so I had so many
        conflicts internally that I couldn't share with you. Everytime you
        implied to ask me to buy this buy that even though you didn't explicitly
        ask, I was extremely hurt. I tried to show it to you, I tried to tell
        you. Eventually you learnt and I'm glad, but it would not last as I
        found out you were still financially irresponsible. You don't save
        money. You depend on your cousin so you didn't need to depend on me. But
        can I really change a person? I don't know. I don't know if I can change
        you. I didn't want to tell you to change. The ability to choose one's
        choices is what makes life worth living. I didn't want to force you to
        change. I wanted you to change because you wanted to change. I wanted
        you to change because you wanted to be better. I could only hope, and
        watch from afar as I continued loving you. I was really scared of losing
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everytime I said I love you. I really meant it but I was hurt everytime
        I said it. I was hurt because I knew it won't incentivize you to change.
        I was hurt because I knew you were not changing. I stil love you even
        now. As much as I can't explain why I love you and I want to know why I
        love you, I just simply love you. I shouldn't but I know I do.
