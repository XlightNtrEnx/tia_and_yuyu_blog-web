      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <p>
        I love you, and I still do. I'm still regretting my decision to leave
        you. I'm sorry for causing hurt to you. I still cannot get back to you,
        but I hope you can forgive me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never really loved you from the start. I was at the lowest point in my
        life. I lost all my friends because I was too emotional. I saw you as
        someone I could have fun a lot with. Over time, I begin developing
        feelings for you, but it was not yet love. I was still too broken over
        what had happened. But, I saw you as a close friend and nothing more
        than that before you confessed to me. I was too scared to lose you just
        like I did with my friends so I had to take a day to collect myself.
        Eventually I decided I really did not want to lose you even if I did not
        love you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time as we interacted, I became more and more attached to you. My
        scars were healing from my drama I had. I was beginning to love you, and
        eventually I did. It drove me to creating this website for you. Showing
        my appreciation not with my money but my efforts. I was really
        heartbroken when you did not give me anything back in return for my
        efforts, even as I kept waiting and waiting. I questioned your love for
        me and that was our first fight we had.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was really hurt by that. Since then, I had stopped loving you. More
        precisely, I was too scared to love you. I did not want to get hurt
        again. But you showed me that you really did love me. I was really happy
        that you did. I was really happy with your gifts. At the same time I was
        worried about you. You had spent so much for me and yet you were not
        doing very well. You didn't have money. You had nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        You had nothing to your name. You had no sense of responsibility. You
        had no hobbies. You had no job. If I don't address them now, they will
        not magically disappear after marriage. I needed to change you, at the
        same time, love to me was not changing someone, so I had so many
        conflicts internally that I couldn't share with you. Everytime you
        implied to ask me to buy this buy that even though you didn't explicitly
        ask, I was extremely hurt. I tried to show it to you, I tried to tell
        you. Eventually you learnt and I'm glad, but it would not last as I
        found out you were still financially irresponsible. You don't save
        money. You depend on your cousin so you didn't need to depend on me
