        I love you, and I still do. I'm still regretting my decision to leave
        you. I'm sorry for causing hurt to you. I still cannot get back to you,
        but I hope you can forgive me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never really loved you from the start. I was at the lowest point in my
        life. I lost all my friends because I was too emotional. I saw you as
        someone I could have fun a lot with. Over time, I begin developing
        feelings for you, but it was not yet love. I was still too broken over
        what had happened. But, I saw you as a close friend and nothing more
        than that before you confessed to me. I was too scared to lose you just
        like I did with my friends so I had to take a day to collect myself.
        Eventually I decided I really did not want to lose you even if I did not
        love you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time as we interacted, I became more and more attached to you. My
        scars were healing from my drama I had. I was beginning to love you, and
        eventually I did. It drove me to creating this website for you. Showing
        my appreciation not with my money but my efforts. I was really
        heartbroken when you did not give me anything back in return for my
        efforts, even as I kept waiting and waiting. I questioned your love for
        me and that was our first fight we had.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was really hurt by that. Since then, I had stopped loving you. More
        precisely, I was too scared to love you. I did not want to get hurt
        again. But you showed me that you really did love me. I was really happy
        that you did. I was really happy with your gifts. At the same time I was
        worried about you. You had spent so much for me and yet you were not
        doing very well. You didn't have money. You had nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        You had nothing to your name. You had no sense of responsibility. You
        had no hobbies. You had no job. If I don't address them now, they will
        not magically disappear after marriage. I needed to change you, at the
        same time, love to me was not changing someone, so I had so many
        conflicts internally that I couldn't share with you. Everytime you
        implied to ask me to buy this buy that even though you didn't explicitly
        ask, I was extremely hurt. I tried to show it to you, I tried to tell
        you. Eventually you learnt and I'm glad, but it would not last as I
        found out you were still financially irresponsible. You don't save
        money. You depend on your cousin so you didn't need to depend on me. But
        can I really change a person? I don't know. I don't know if I can change
        you. I didn't want to tell you to change. The ability to choose one's
        choices is what makes life worth living. I didn't want to force you to
        change. I wanted you to change because you wanted to change. I wanted
        you to change because you wanted to be better. I could only hope, and
        watch from afar as I continued loving you. I was really scared of losing
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everytime I said I love you. I really meant it but I was hurt everytime
        I said it. I was hurt because I knew it won't incentivize you to change.
        I was hurt because I knew you were not changing. I stil love you even
        now. As much as I can't explain why I love you and I want to know why I
        love you, I just simply love you. I shouldn't but I know I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here's the biggest problem. Somewhere along the way, I don't know
        how it happened, but it did. It felt as though I was forced to give my
        time and attention to you when you wanted it. I couldn't say no unless I
        had a valid reason like work. If I had free time I needed to give it to
        you instead of myself. I was really tired but I still kept loving you
        and giving you what you wanted. I could tell you were trying to give me
        time as well but I was still too tired. I didn't want to spend time
        talking with you about irrelevant things. I wanted to create quality
        moments with you where we could laugh together. I don't want to focus on
        the drama you have in class because I see it as something that you
        shouldn't focus on. You should only focus on yourself and your
        happiness. But I cared about your feelings and I could see you were
        hurt, so I tried to be consoling by being practical and pointing out
        that being class chairperson isn't a big deal but you were still hurt,
        and I was hurt if you became in a bad mood. All these things combined
        just made me feel as though our relationship was inorganic. It was
        forced. I just want to not feel guilty about not hopping onto vc with
        you or not replying to your messages because I was busy. It felt as
        though I had to constantly survey my phone to see if you had messaged
        me. I had to join vc everyday to attend to your needs instead of
        focusing on what I need and want to do. I had to break my focus to reply
        to you and lose my train of thoughts. I was really tired. I didn't want
        to do this anymore. I wanted to be free. I wanted to be myself. I wanted
        to be happy. I wanted to be with you. I wanted to be with you but I
        didn't want to be with you. I was really confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sorry but I cannot continue this relationship, because I know that
        you have created a dependency on me and I couldn't talk to you about it.
        You asked me to work it out with you, but I can't... I can't force you
        to change. I can only hope. I'm sorry for breaking your heart. I'm sorry
        for causing you pain. I'm sorry for causing you to cry. I'm sorry for
        causing you to be sad. I'm sorry for causing you to be angry. I'm sorry
        for causing you to be disappointed. I 'm sorry for causing you to be
        hurt. If our paths cross again, I hope that we can get back together.
      </p>
